"My first ceremony as I perceive it now with my grandfather was him taking me down to a pond in a ditch bank and sitting me down at probably age six and just telling me with his eyes to sit. And he sat next to me and we sat for a long time until all this life came around us. This just incredibly beautiful life. And I was sitting there in my mind going okay what are we gonna do? What's he gonna teach me? And where are we going to go and stuff? And he's looking at me and he's going with his eyes just sit. And so pretty soon the frogs come up and birds are all around us and everything. And then there's all these incredible dragonflies, like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies that are flying all around us. It's different colors, you know, the brilliant turquoise and really bright intense crimson. And these, some of them are really small damsel flies and others are like five inches long. And they're right in front of me and pretty soon I'm realizing that the whole time they are copulating and they're flying right up to me you know with the male or the female looking into my eyes right here and the other one attached facing the other direction. And I'm six, you know. And all this life around me is having sex. You know, they're procreating and the energy was just over the top beautiful. And, I couldn't think anymore I could only be there, you know. And I could only realize that I was completely immersed in, swallowed up and part of this incredible thing that people call Nature. And I was just "ahh" like this .... and then I got calm with it and I looked at my grandfather and he nodded, you know. And I realized later, much later in my life, that that was my first ceremony."
