Excerpts from: Moving Beyond Polarization in Service of Life | Reality Roundtable 10 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDtn0eEas7c

"I just wanted to say out of appreciation, even though it's off topic, forgive me, this is my first time meeting Rex, and I just, let him know that my 11th birthday as a kid was at the Greenpeace headquarters, and, many early experiences that put me on this path had to do with early exposures that Greenpeace was a part of, so I feel a great debt of, appreciation.

The topic of there are no separable things. We have these boundaries, you know, our skin defines a physical boundary. We can look at boundaries of creatures or, ecosystems. But the boundaries are permeable, and they're exchanging energy, information, and matter bidirectionally, and if they weren't, the thing that we call the thing would be dead, wouldn't exist. If my lungs weren't taking in other than me, if they weren't releasing things that were me to other than me, if my digestive system wasn't taking in other than me, if my system wasn't  able to process the energy, information, matter exchange, there would be no me. And so, yes, there's a boundary. But the critical thing is the information exchange across that boundary. This is true for all things. So that's a communication, right? That's a communication of every being with its environment without which it wouldn't exist.  So literally there are no separable things. 

What would I be without the atmosphere? I wouldn't be. What would I be without the plants that mediate it? I wouldn't be. What would I be without the bacteria and fungus in the soil that allow the plants to be? I wouldn't 
be. What would I be without the electromagnetic field or the strong force or the sun or the center of the galaxy? I wouldn't be. And so I am an emergent property of all those things and all the people that created the language that I think in and all of the ideas that I was taught. And, so I'm not a separate thing. I'm not a separable thing. I'm an emergent property of everything else, right? And there's some, there's uniqueness and interconnectedness."

===================================

"So thank you for that. you mentioned monoculture and, diversity. Rex, what happens when communication and information becomes ... And you as a lifelong study, a student of ecology and the natural world, is there a natural world analog for this of, what Nora just said, monotone conversations?"

"Nora said it. It's, the monoculture. It's when you cut down a forest and then you plant trees all in a row and think that you have a new forest. And you do not, because you have killed off those relationships. You've destroyed those relationships."

===================================

"Vanessa, do you mind if I ask you to, remind,  me, the quote that you shared about the essence of colonialism."

"Right. So it's Chief Ninawas' voice saying that colonialism, so there's, in the literature, we see colonialism generally represented as the, either the oppression, the subjugation of people or the occupation of lands. But Chief Ninawas talks about the root of colonialism being the imposed false sense of separability between humans and the land that then creates the conditions for all the hierarchies and rankings of species and cultures and peoples. And it's, it, is not a concept. It is a neurophysical issue."
