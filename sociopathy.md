"We started doing a research project recently on what the equivalent of sociopathy and dark triad traits and indigenous cultures were, and we haven't finished, but this is something I'm very interested in and for the most part, what we've seen so far is there was radically less of that trait, because there wasn't an evolutionary niche for it, Because in a small Dunbar tribe, if you lied, everybody knew you lied and if you f@%ked somebody, you were f@%king the people that your life depends upon, and so in that small environment there was just not a niche for it. The niche came later. I did talk to a Lakota scholar who said in the Lakota tribe, if a kid had the traits that they referred to as the equivalent of sociopathy, the whole tribe worked to heal it in them and if they didn't heal it in them at the rite of passage ceremony of puberty, where they become an adult, they were killed, because they said that if that didn't happen, those people when they grew up always caused war."
