okay, my entire worldview just shifted and need to share!

researching for an upcoming series on designing bioregional scale regenerative economies and villages (videos coming out over the next year) and learned something absolutely mind boggling.

I mean, I intuitively knew this truth I just didn't realize how extreme it was.

I was comparing human-designed food production systems vs human+animals+microbiology+etc designed food production systems.

ex, US food production:

🌾 96 Billion Lbs of Wheat
🌽 67 Billion Lbs Corn
🥛 218 Billion Lbs Milk

BILLIONS, that's a LOT of food!!

🚜 makes sense we're creating so much! After all, centuries of industrial progress, all the epic technology we've built 🛰️, it's obvious that we'd be producing so much food!

When you add up ALL the food the US produces - it's the majority of the way to a full TRILLION lbs in one single country of 340m that's nearly 3k pounds of food (7-8 lbs/day) per person!

😳 wow!

But, that's not what surprised me.

What really blew my mind was to learn that a single mature American Chestnut Tree (which used to dominate the forests of Eastern US) produces 3000 lbs of chestnut fruit/nut (which is an incredibly nutritious and complete food source).

Then I learned there was once 3-4 Billion of these trees in US forests.

I did the math and my jaw dropped. I had to do the math 3 times to verify.

9-12 TRILLION lbs FREE FOOD FALLING FROM THE SKY EACH YEAR!

🌰A single tree species in only half the US and taking up no farmland, provided 9-12 TIMES MORE than ALL the food the US currently produces, with ALL our technology and advancements!

This is before we get into the oaks (acorns), paw paws (epic mango like fruit), and 100's of food producing species thriving in these ancient forests.

😭There's <10k Great American Chestnut trees alive today.

The truth I already knew was that the abundance of nature with her billions of years of technological evolution does a better job than our few centuries of "progress".

What happened?

🐟 We damned the rivers and stopped the Salmon from bringing ocean nutrients (like nitrogen, fruiting plants need) deep into forests. "salmon so numerous you could cross the river on their backs" - Native American saying

🦫 We hunted the beavers for their fur (colonizers loved fur hats, so fancy 🎩) and stopped them from managing the water cycles (the beavers made a slower/flatter water terrain for salmon to get even deeper into the forests, meadows and landscape
est. 300m+ then <13m now

🐻 We hunted the bears for their skin, flesh, sport, and because we saw them as competition (eating "our" salmon!). This stopped them from carrying the salmon deep into the forests from the rivers and nurturing those chestnut trees and so many others. 🐻 are food foresters and do an epic job! If a 🐻 can eat it, we can too!
est. 2m+ then <300k now

🐳 🦌 🦊 🦅 🐦 so many others came together to co-create food abundance/health

🌍 We're not alone in our quest to heal Earth.
