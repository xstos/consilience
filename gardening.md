"I hate to break it to you, but we've all been lied to about gardening. If you grew up gardening like me, you were probably taught that you need to spend money on fertilizer and amendments. You may have heard that if you really want a good garden, you need to do soil tests and add in any nutrients your soil is lacking, according to those tests. Now, that's a convenient thing for companies to have you believe, so that you are dependent on their products.

But I'm here to tell you that if you follow these five gardening principles, you will never need to buy fertilizer. Even if you're starting with really bad soil, your plants will be able to get all the nutrients they need through the microbes in the ground. To help them do that, we need to stop using fertilizer. Using these principles is how we turn dense clay soil like this into crumbly, dark, nutrient-rich soil.

Principle number one: Avoid soil disturbance. This means avoiding both mechanical and chemical disturbance—anything that's going to disrupt the microbiome of the soil. This means stop rototilling your garden and stop spraying pesticides. Both tilling and pesticides destroy microbes in the soil, and it's those microbes that plants are supposed to get their nutrients from. That's why fertilizer companies always recommend you till your soil; they know it makes you more dependent on fertilizer. If you want to be independent from these companies, you have to stop doing things the way they recommend.

Of course, you still need to get your seeds under the soil, so a little digging just to plant your seeds is totally fine.

Principle number two: Keep your soil covered. Near your house, there's probably a barren field that’s been scraped clean and is now overgrown with weeds. This is what nature does to bare soil; it's trying to cover it. The sun has a sterilizing effect on soil, and those weeds act as a cover crop, slowly improving the soil so that other plants, like grasses, can eventually grow.

You need to keep soil covered for nutrients to cycle, which can be done by living plants or by a thick layer of mulch. This mulch could be straw, hay, animal bedding, wood chips, grass clippings, or crop remains from the last season. Keeping the soil covered helps retain moisture, nutrients, and organic matter, allowing microbes to proliferate. These combined factors help cycle nutrients, so if you want soil that produces all the nutrients your garden needs, you need to keep it covered.

Principle number three: Diversity. There are very few places in nature where you actually find monocultures. Even in a lush grassland that looks like it’s all the same species, there’s a lot of diversity, including dormant plants that you might not see. Having a diversity of plants growing together is essential for building soil. Planting diverse cover crop mixes around your food crops is a great way to make this happen. You want as many living plants with living roots in the ground as possible.

Principle number four: Always have living roots in the soil. These roots create different types of microbe foods, called exudates, which feed microbes that provide the nutrients plants need. These exudates change based on the nutrients the plant lacks, attracting the right microbes to provide those nutrients. Exudates are carbon-based and add organic matter to the soil. So, the longer you have living roots in the soil, the more organic matter you’re putting into it.

This organic matter allows microbes to transform the soil through a process called aggregation. This is how plants and microbes can take heavy clay soil that doesn’t drain well and turn it into light, fluffy, “chocolate cake” soil that soaks up water like a sponge. The most important factor in making this happen is to have living roots in the soil as long as possible.

Principle five: Integrate animals. This can range from insects and earthworms to larger animals like cows, sheep, or chickens. In my case, I cut down my cover crops and feed them to my rabbits. Then I take the rabbit manure and spread it back on the garden. This simulates grazing and adds a lot of microbial diversity to the soil. Many plants also respond to grazing by growing bigger root systems, which means more soil building and nutrient cycling.

Growing lots of flowers to attract pollinators and keeping the soil covered with decomposing mulch also helps attract earthworms. Those are a couple of ways you can support this integration.

By doing all of this, you’ll be practicing what’s called regenerative gardening. This method captures carbon from the atmosphere and puts it into the soil as organic matter, creating all the nutrients your plants need."
