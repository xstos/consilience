"Children today find themselves in a very different world. Children lack the support of care that grows social, emotional and ecological intelligences. Most human children today live in societies that are fractured and inflamed with domination, alienation and intolerance, societies that are damaging all evolved nests, human and non-human. Many of us have forgotten Nature's ways, but there is hope for healing and restoration"
