transcript excerpt from "Medicine Wheel Teaching" https://youtu.be/oGC1EncFa50?t=661 follows:

Well this one time we went into the bush, and we were um collecting willowed willow trees and willow branches. And so he carried the tobacco, but he was running up on the trail ahead of me.

And I saw this really nice clump of willow trees beside me, so I called him back and I said, "Shane, can you come back? Bring the tobacco."

So he comes running back, and he just stands there and he looks up at the willow trees. And he just stands there, and for some reason, I didn't say anything—I just waited.

And then he turns to me and he says, "No, no, Kukum. These trees aren't ready to die yet. Come on, let's keep going."

So off he went, and I just followed very quietly and just really thinking. And then he's calling me, he says, "Kukumku, come! Hurry!"

So I catch up to him, and he says, "Kukum, these trees say you can cut them down."

So I said, "Okay, can you put the tobacco down?" And he said, "No, no, Kukum. They want you to put the tobacco down." So he hands me the tobacco.

And he says, "And they also want you to tell them what you're going to use them for."

So that's what I did. As I was thanking the trees for the gift of their lives, I told them what I was going to be using them for.

But I always remember that that was my first lesson of somebody hearing the trees communicate with them.

And since that time, I've learned—and I've learned that yes, I have to be quiet, and I often have to be still.

And since that time, many, many times, I have been in communication with different relations on the land.

And then, after that happened with my grandson, I spoke to some elders and I told him about it. And I asked him, "Um, is this—is this what I'm supposed to be doing?"

And he said, "Yes, of course." He said, "When you're putting tobacco down, that's a time for your prayer. That's a time for you to ask for permission to take them. And if they're not agreeable to that, they will let you know.
