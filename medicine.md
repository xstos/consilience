transcript excerpt from "Medicine Wheel Teaching" https://youtu.be/oGC1EncFa50?t=661 follows:

Well this one time we went into the bush, and we were um collecting willowed willow trees and willow branches. And so he carried the tobacco, but he was running up on the trail ahead of me.

And I saw this really nice clump of willow trees beside me, so I called him back and I said, "Shane, can you come back? Bring the tobacco."

So he comes running back, and he just stands there and he looks up at the willow trees. And he just stands there, and for some reason, I didn't say anything—I just waited.

And then he turns to me and he says, "No, no, Kukum. These trees aren't ready to die yet. Come on, let's keep going."

So off he went, and I just followed very quietly and just really thinking. And then he's calling me, he says, "Kukumku, come! Hurry!"

So I catch up to him, and he says, "Kukum, these trees say you can cut them down."

So I said, "Okay, can you put the tobacco down?" And he said, "No, no, Kukum. They want you to put the tobacco down." So he hands me the tobacco.

And he says, "And they also want you to tell them what you're going to use them for."

So that's what I did. As I was thanking the trees for the gift of their lives, I told them what I was going to be using them for.

But I always remember that that was my first lesson of somebody hearing the trees communicate with them.

And since that time, I've learned—and I've learned that yes, I have to be quiet, and I often have to be still.

And since that time, many, many times, I have been in communication with different relations on the land.

And then, after that happened with my grandson, I spoke to some elders and I told him about it. And I asked him, "Um, is this—is this what I'm supposed to be doing?"

And he said, "Yes, of course." He said, "When you're putting tobacco down, that's a time for your prayer. That's a time for you to ask for permission to take them. And if they're not agreeable to that, they will let you know.

"Okay, I want to give another example of how we show respect for the land, and that's about the language that we use. Even if we use the English language, we can still use the language in a very respectful way.

For example, when we're meeting with MNR, MNR talks about natural resources. They say "natural resources," and sometimes they'll say "renewable natural resources" or "non-renewable natural resources." Those words are very foreign to us. The words that we use when we talk about the land, when we talk about the animals and the birds and the trees and the grass and the rocks and the fish, the insects, the snakes and reptiles—all of them are our relations.

When we refer to them all together, we say "all our relations." Even in our ceremonies, we talk about "all our relations" because that's what the relationship is about. When we say "all our relations," that already presupposes there's a relationship there. When MNR says "natural resources," that's a very different relationship. That relationship is based on ownership.

Following the same example, when MNR talks about the trees, they talk about what they get from the trees—like lumber, chips, and the pulp that they make from there. They call these "products." For us, when we get a gift from a tree, that's what we call it—it's a gift. When we get hide from a moose, and from that hide we make moccasins, mitts, snowshoes, drums—there are so many gifts from a moose. Hundreds of gifts from the moose. I could do a whole day workshop on gifts from the moose.

And that's the difference. The words that we use—"gifts" and not "products"—it's a very different feeling we get when we use those words. When we say "all our relations," it's a very different feeling than when we say "natural resources." It's a very different feeling that we get when we say "gifts" than when we say "products."

And that's what the importance of language is. We call the land our mother in our language. We call the land ning—our mother. Sometimes we say kimaman—our mother—in English. In MNR words, they call the land "environment," they call the land "crown land," they call the land "estate." They call it all kinds of words that take away from that relationship of the land being our mother.

The words that MNR uses—that's in the English language—those tend to disconnect us from the land. The words that we use reconnect us to the land. They continually connect us to the land, and that's the important thing. That's one of the most important relationships that we have to work on—our relationship to the land."
