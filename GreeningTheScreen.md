GREENING THE SCREEN
Our Planet Magazine - 2001
John Dennis Liu - Director of the Environmental Education Television Project for China.

Imagine the ability to communicate with everyone on Earth,
simultaneously and instantaneously. Imagine the ability to
connect the foremost medical authorities with sufferers of
debilitating and treatable diseases on the other side of the planet.
Imagine the ability to explore in conditions where no human
being can survive. Imagine the ability to speak to the hearts and
souls of those who, from ignorance and fear, have been enemies
for generations. Imagine the ability to ensure that everyone can
understand and participate in conservation measures vital to the
future of humanity.

Now imagine this. The camera plays over anxious faces of
victims. Matte black high-calibre weapons exude professional
menace matched by the discipline of the perpetrators. Tension
rises by degrees as skilled cinematographers manipulate the scene
and the viewers. Fear is palpable, but if you are not sufficiently
terrified, the soundtrack reinforces it. Then an orgy of violence so
well choreographed that the trajectory of bullets, the splattering of
blood and bone, are elevated to a ballet of motion and colour.
Scenes like that are played out each day on television around the
world. This is not an epic morality play. The creators are not
seeking to identify and reinforce cultural values. This is
entertainment. Around the world, millions of viewers are being
desensitized. Violence, vacuity, voyeurism Other than the rare
isolated exception, or the deeply thoughtful who reject TV, it is
possible to reach virtually every human being on the planet with a
television signal. But what kind of programming is being
delivered to this massive global audience? All too often it gets a
steady stream of violence, sexual innuendo or vacuous quiz
shows. Even the news concentrates on disasters, sometimes
replacing what should be a public service with a kind of morbid
voyeurism. We are shown technically proficient but increasingly
brutal professional sports. All punctuated with advertisements
aimed at selling an unsustainable lifestyle.
Excellent programmes and the amazing potential of television are
obscured. Hundreds of millions of viewers in the developing
world are being conditioned to violence and seduced by images of
affluence and excess they cannot share.

At the same time as we are being ‘entertained’, climate change
threatens to exact an almost unthinkable toll, chemicals are
destroying the protective ozone layer, the Earth is losing its
forests, persistent organic pollutants find their way to the farthest
reaches of the planet, the world’s oceans degrade, and countless
species disappear forever.

Barriers to understanding and sharing are being reduced as nations 
and individuals grasp the advantages of communicating

We need television to communicate the extreme dangers that the
Earth and humanity face from environmental degradation; to
communicate new scientific and technical breakthroughs that may
help us build a sustainable future; to multiply the efforts of
thoughtful and concerned citizens everywhere striving to envision
and build sustainable systems; to invite and encourage everyone
to reduce their own ‘ecological footprint’. The purpose of this
wonderful capability should not be to anaesthetize an
institutionalized underclass, to deliver government propaganda or
to enrich media barons.

Over the past few years the power of television has helped
transform environmental awareness in China. Once virtually
unknown, environmental issues have become of foremost concern
to ordinary citizens.

The Environmental Education Television Project for China
(EETPC) – a civil society, participatory project – is having a
profound effect on how the Chinese view the natural and human
environments. This international non-profit effort links Chinese
academic, government and non-government organizations –
including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of
Scientific and Technical Information of China, the State
Environmental Protection Administration, the Friends of Nature
and the Global Village – and is supported internationally by the
Television Trust for the Environment (TVE International), UNEP,
the World Wide Fund For Nature, the European Commission, the
United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations
Children’s Fund, UNAIDS, the Heinrich Böll Foundation, the
Jane Goodall Institute and many others.

Since it started operation less than five years ago, EETPC has
brought to China hundreds of the best environmental films from
all over the world, and dubbed them into Chinese; some have also 
been dubbed into Tibetan, Mongolian and Uighur. Hundreds of
millions of people have been reached by daily and weekly
environmental series including: Earth Report, Earthscan, Our
Home, Centuries Alarm and Anima Mundi – The Soul of Life,
together broadcast by EETPC with such partners as China Central
Television, China Radio International Television Department, and
provincial and local stations throughout China.

There is also tremendous interest in China in using audiovisual
materials for environmental education. Wide participation has
ensured that thousands of people and hundreds of institutions
have been able to use them to reach millions of viewers. Partners
including the Institute of Science and Technical Information of
China, the China Youth Development Foundation and the Beijing
Education Bureau have helped to manufacture and distribute
videos and video CDs, empowering others to learn and teach.

Encouragement for innovation 
 
In 1998, a retired engineer called Li Guang Yu visited the EETPC and saw a film showing
how a village in India converted to biogas for lighting and
cooking. Armed with a copy of the programme, and a small grant
from the Canadian International Development Agency, he then
built a biogas digester in his home village, Long Jia Tian in
Guizhou Province. It was so successful that everyone in the
village copied it, and county officials promoted it in other
villages. Local people are no longer using wood for cooking
where the biogas systems are in use. This is allowing trees and
undergrowth to return, protecting the soil, lessening the threat of
flooding and freeing people, particularly women and children,
from backbreaking, destructive labour. District officials in An
Shun, after studying Mr. Li’s digester, now plan to build 100,000
biogas systems.

The results of Mr. Li’s viewing are dramatic, but not unique.
Every day, in every province of China, similar film screenings are
being held. EETPC and its many partners are using television to
help to educate one fifth of the world’s people about why and
how to protect the environment for themselves and for future
generations. This is proving that television can do a great deal
more to address global environmental issues and that
environmental education television is especially applicable in
developing countries.

The Internet is often touted as the tool for reaching the world’s 
poor with development messages. It does indeed have tremendous
potential, but it will be years, perhaps decades, before it can reach
everyone. The Earth’s environmental problems just will not wait.
Ordinary people can achieve excellent results when they choose
to participate in educating themselves and their communities
about the environment. But we need the powerful tool of
television to reach everyone. Then the only limit is our
imagination.
