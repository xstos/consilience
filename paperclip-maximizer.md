"One could draw a parallel to capitalism, likening it to a form of paperclip maximizer[1]. Though capitalism is not conscious, it acts as an optimization function aimed at maximizing profit, measured by currency. This optimization function drives production and services to yield ever-increasing economic value. However, the interest on the monetary supply demands exponential growth, which necessitates continuous increases in goods and services. Consequently, this fuels resource extraction and environmental impact. Only values that are measurable and exchangeable, such as goods with a dollar value, contribute to economic power, while unmeasurable values, like the joy from sunshine or birdsong, are excluded. If activities pollute the air or harm the environment in pursuit of profit, non-exchangeable values suffer without corresponding market consequences. Over time, this leads to an economy that prioritizes measurable value, akin to a paperclip maximizer fixated on profit.

This paperclip-maximizing tendency can also be seen in the evolution of financial systems, from barter to complex financial instruments. Each step in this evolution represents an increase in the system's efficiency at converting various assets into measurable economic value. Derivatives, for example, turn complex, future possibilities into quantifiable financial value, showcasing how capitalism, like a paperclip maximizer, continually refines its optimization.

In this framework, "Moloch" symbolizes the emergent property of unbounded competitive game theory, particularly among entities capable of exponential growth in their capacities—through tool-making, for example. Moloch represents the darker side of competition, the relentless drive of self-interest at the expense of unquantifiable values. Addressing the challenge of Moloch is thus about mitigating the destructive aspects of this optimization without needing to "kill" Moloch. Instead, the goal is to transform Moloch’s influence from dark to light, reorienting competitive instincts towards outcomes that benefit all rather than focusing solely on extractable metrics."
